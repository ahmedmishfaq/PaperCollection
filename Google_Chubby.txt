Chubby: A distrubuted Lock service
-------------------------------------
-- Intended for coarse-grained synchronization of activities within Google's Distributed Systems.
-- Had wider use as a name service.
-- Used as a repository for configuration information.

Basis of the design of Chubby:
----------------------------------
1. Distributed consensus among a few replicas for fault tolerance.
2. Consistent client-side caching to reduce server load while retaining simple semantics.
3. Timely notification of updates.
4. Keeping a Familiar file system interface.
5. Use caching, protocol-conversion servers, simple load adaptation to allow it scale to tens
of thousands of client processes per Chubby instance.
6. Can be scaled farther in future via proxies and partitioning.

Use:
------
1. It has become google's primary internal name service.
2. It is a common rendezvous mechanism for systems such as MapReduce.
3. The storage systems GFS and Bigtable use Chubby to elect a primary from redundant replicas.
4. It is a standard repository for files that require high availability -- 
	 example --- access control lists
